# Mathematical Concepts - Overview

**Category:** Mathematical Concepts (`mathematical_concepts/`)

## 1. General Concept

Mathematical principles often underpin efficient algorithms and problem-solving strategies in competitive programming. Recognizing and applying relevant mathematical concepts can lead to simpler logic, faster algorithms, or proofs of correctness.

This section aims to document key mathematical ideas and formulas frequently encountered in LeetCode problems.
