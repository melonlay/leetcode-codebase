# Pattern: Phased Simulation for Large K Operations

**Context:** Problems involving a very large number of operations (`k`, e.g., `10^9` or larger) applied sequentially, often based on the current state of a data structure (like finding the minimum in an array/heap). Direct simulation is too slow (`O(k * log n)` or similar).

**Core Idea:** Decompose the process into distinct phases:

1.  **Initial Transient Phase (Phase 1):** Simulate the operations step-by-step only until the system reaches a "stable" or predictable state.
    *   **Goal:** The primary goal of this phase is often *not* to track exact intermediate values meticulously, but to determine the *state* (e.g., relative order of elements, identification of active elements) required for the next phase's calculation.
    *   **Stopping Condition:** This phase stops when either `k` operations are completed, or a specific stability criterion is met. Common criteria include:
        *   All relevant elements have been affected at least once (e.g., using a `set` of seen indices). This is generally safer but might run longer.
        *   A heuristic condition suggesting stability, such as the smallest element after multiplication exceeding the largest initial value (`new_val > initial_max`). This can be much faster but relies on problem-specific properties for correctness.
    *   **Implementation:** Often involves a data structure like a heap. Track remaining `k`. Remember the heap state at the end of this phase.

2.  **Stable / Bulk Calculation Phase (Phase 2):** Once the initial phase is complete, calculate the effect of the *remaining* `k` operations in bulk, leveraging the properties of the stable state.
    *   **Common Stable State:** A frequent stable state is a "round-robin" pattern where operations cycle through all `n` elements in a predictable order based on their relative values established at the end of Phase 1.
    *   **Bulk Calculation:**
        *   Calculate remaining operations `rem_ops = k` (value of k after Phase 1).
        *   Determine the number of full cycles: `num_cycles = rem_ops // n`.
        *   Determine the remaining partial cycle operations: `final_few_ops = rem_ops % n`.
        *   Determine the order of elements for remainder ops based on the **state at the end of Phase 1**. This can be done by popping `final_few_ops` times from the Phase 1 heap state or by sorting the Phase 1 heap state (`O(n log n)`).
        *   Calculate the *effective Phase 2 exponent* for each element based on `num_cycles` and whether it receives a remainder op.
        *   **Optimization:** Pre-calculate the cycle multiplier `common_mult = pow(multiplier, num_cycles, MOD)` once.
    *   **Final Result:** Combine the results from Phase 1 (implicitly captured by the *value* `val_p1` at its end) with the calculated effects of Phase 2. 
        *   Optimized calculation: `final_val = (val_p1 * common_mult * (multiplier if remainder_applies else 1)) % MOD`.
        *   Standard calculation: `final_val = (val_p1 * pow(multiplier, phase_2_exponent, MOD)) % MOD`.

**Why it Works:**
*   Avoids simulating every single operation for large `k`.
*   Phase 1 simulation is bounded (often related to `n` rather than `k`).
*   Phase 2 calculation is typically fast (`O(n)` or `O(n log n)` depending on how remainder targets are found).

**Example:**
*   LeetCode 3266 (Final Array State II): Phase 1 can stop early using `new_val > initial_max`. Phase 2 calculates `common = pow(mult, k//n, MOD)`. Determines remainder targets based on sorted Phase 1 heap state (`rank i`). Final calculation: `ans[idx] = (val_p1 * common * (multiplier if i < k%n else 1)) % MOD`.
