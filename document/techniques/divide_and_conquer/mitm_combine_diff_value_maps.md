# Technique: Meet-in-the-Middle Combination for Diff/Value Maps

## Description

This technique applies during the "Combine / Meet" step of the [[../patterns/divide_and_conquer/meet_in_the_middle.md]] pattern, specifically when the results generated from the two halves are stored in maps (dictionaries) where:
*   Keys represent a *difference* (often absolute difference) between two conceptual parts within that half.
*   Values represent an associated *metric* (e.g., the sum/height of one part, often the smaller one) for that difference.

The goal is typically to combine results from the two halves (`map1`, `map2`) such that the *final combined difference is zero*, and a *combined metric* (like total sum/height) is maximized.

## Core Idea

Assume:
*   `map1[diff1] = value1`: `diff1` is the absolute difference in half 1, `value1` is the corresponding metric (e.g., shorter height).
*   `map2[diff2] = value2`: `diff2` is the absolute difference in half 2, `value2` is the corresponding metric.

To achieve a final difference of zero when combining, the absolute differences from the two halves **must be equal** (`diff1 == diff2`). When combining, we typically pair the part associated with `value1` (e.g., shorter side) from half 1 with the other part (e.g., taller side) from half 2, and vice-versa, to balance out the differences.

## Algorithm Steps (Example: Maximize Equal Partition Sum)

Let `d1[k] = v1` mean: In half 1, for absolute difference `k`, the max shorter height is `v1`. Taller height is `v1 + k`.
Let `d2[k] = v2` mean: In half 2, for absolute difference `k`, the max shorter height is `v2`. Taller height is `v2 + k`.

1.  **Generate Maps:** Compute `d1` and `d2` by running the appropriate generation algorithm (e.g., the optimized DP) on each half of the input.
2.  **Iterate and Combine:**
    *   Initialize `max_combined_value = 0` (or appropriate minimum).
    *   Iterate through `(k1, v1)` pairs in `d1`.
    *   **Check for Matching Difference:** If `k1` exists as a key in `d2`:
        *   Let `v2 = d2[k1]`.
        *   **Calculate Combined Value:** The final equal height/sum is achieved by combining shorter from one half with taller from the other:
            `combined_value = v1` (Short_1) + `v2 + k1` (Tall_2) = `v1 + v2 + k1`
            *(Equivalently: `v1 + k1` (Tall_1) + `v2` (Short_2) = `v1 + k1 + v2`)*
        *   **Update Maximum:** `max_combined_value = max(max_combined_value, combined_value)`.
3.  **Result:** `max_combined_value`.

## Complexity

*   Let `|d1|` and `|d2|` be the sizes of the maps generated (e.g., up to `O(3^(N/2))` or `O(S/2)` depending on analysis).
*   The combination step involves iterating through `d1` and performing lookups in `d2` (average O(1) for hash maps).
*   **Combination Time Complexity:** O(|d1|)

## Implementation Notes

*   Ensuring the generation function (`diff_h` in the example) correctly computes the `(difference, value)` pairs according to the problem definition is crucial.
*   Using hash maps (dictionaries) makes the `k1 in d2` check efficient.
