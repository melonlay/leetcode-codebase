# Optimization: Recursive Descent vs. Iterative Stack Parsing for Nested Expressions

When parsing expressions with nested structures (like braces `{}`) involving operations like set union (e.g., comma-separated terms) and concatenation/Cartesian product (e.g., adjacent terms/factors), two common approaches are recursive descent and iterative parsing using an explicit stack.

## Problem Context Example

Consider grammars like LeetCode 1096 (Brace Expansion II), where:
-   `{e1, e2, ...}` means Union of results from `e1, e2, ...`
-   `t1 t2 ...` means Cartesian Product (concatenation) of results from terms `t1, t2, ...`

## Approaches

1.  **Recursive Descent:**
    *   Naturally mirrors the grammar rules with mutually recursive functions (e.g., `parse_expression`, `parse_term`, `parse_factor`).
    *   Often uses `set` data structures internally to handle uniqueness required by union operations at each step.
    *   Implicitly uses the function call stack to manage nesting.
    *   Example: See `problems/1096_brace_expansion_ii/solution.py` (initial version).

2.  **Iterative Parsing with Explicit Stack:**
    *   Uses a loop to process the input string character by character.
    *   Employs an explicit `stack` data structure to save and restore the state of outer scopes when entering/exiting nested structures (like `{}`).
    *   Typically uses `list`s to accumulate intermediate results for both union terms and concatenated terms within the current scope.
    *   **Key Optimization:** Defers uniqueness calculation. Intermediate results (potentially with duplicates) are stored in lists. The final conversion to a `set` to remove duplicates happens only once at the end.
    *   Example: See analysis in the discussion for LeetCode 1096.

## Performance Comparison & Optimization

*   **Speed:** The iterative stack-based approach is often significantly faster in Python.
*   **Primary Reason: Deferred Uniqueness Calculation:**
    *   The recursive approach frequently performs set operations (insertions, unions), which involve hashing and managing the set's internal structure. This has overhead, especially if performed repeatedly on intermediate results.
    *   The iterative approach uses list appends, creations (list comprehensions), and concatenations for intermediate steps. These operations are generally faster than set operations *when intermediate uniqueness is not required*.
    *   By building intermediate results (including potential duplicates) in lists and performing only a single `set()` conversion at the very end, the iterative method avoids the cumulative cost of intermediate set management.
*   **Secondary Reason: Function Call Overhead:** Iteration avoids the overhead associated with Python's recursive function calls.
*   **Trade-off:** The iterative approach might use more intermediate memory if the number of duplicate strings generated in lists becomes very large before the final `set()` conversion. However, for many problems, the speed gain from deferred uniqueness outweighs this.

## When to Consider

Consider the iterative stack-based approach with deferred uniqueness when:
*   Parsing nested structures.
*   Dealing with operations like union and product where intermediate uniqueness can be deferred.
*   Performance is critical, and the overhead of intermediate set operations might be a bottleneck.
