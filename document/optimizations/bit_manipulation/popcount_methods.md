# Optimization: Population Count (Popcount) Methods

## Description

Population count (or Hamming weight) refers to counting the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of an integer. This is a common operation in bitmask-based algorithms, particularly DP on subsets [[../techniques/dynamic_programming/dp_on_dag_subsets.md]]. Efficiently calculating popcount, especially when needed for many masks, can be a useful micro-optimization.

## Methods in Python

1.  **`int.bit_count()` (Python 3.10+)**
    *   **Usage:** `count = my_integer.bit_count()`
    *   **Pros:** Built-in, implemented in C, generally the fastest method when available.
    *   **Cons:** Only available in Python 3.10 and later.

2.  **`bin(integer).count('1')`**
    *   **Usage:** `count = bin(my_integer).count('1')`
    *   **Pros:** Simple, available in all modern Python versions.
    *   **Cons:** Involves converting the integer to a binary string representation (`"0b..."`) first, which adds overhead. Usually slower than `int.bit_count()` or iterative precomputation.

3.  **Iterative Precomputation Array**
    *   **Usage:** Precompute an array `pc` where `pc[i]` stores the popcount of `i`.
      ```python
      N_states = 1 << n
      pc = [0] * N_states
      for m in range(1, N_states):
          pc[m] = pc[m >> 1] + (m & 1)
      # Later use: count = pc[mask]
      ```
    *   **Pros:** Very fast lookup (O(1)) after O(2^N) precomputation. Often faster than `bin().count('1')`. Competitive with `int.bit_count()` and works on all Python versions.
    *   **Cons:** Requires O(2^N) extra space for the lookup table. Precomputation cost might not be worth it if popcount is needed only a few times.

4.  **Lookup Table (Smaller Blocks - Less Common in Python)**
    *   Precompute popcounts for smaller blocks (e.g., 8 bits) and combine them. Less common in Python due to the overhead of manual bit shifting and masking compared to built-ins or the simple iterative method.

## Recommendation

*   **If using Python 3.10+:** Use `int.bit_count()` directly. It's typically the fastest and requires no extra space.
*   **If using Python < 3.10 OR if precomputation is feasible:** The **Iterative Precomputation Array** method is generally the next best choice, offering O(1) lookup after the initial O(2^N) setup. It often outperforms `bin().count('1')` significantly when popcount is needed repeatedly (e.g., inside the main DP loop).
*   **Fallback:** `bin().count('1')` is always available but likely the slowest for repeated computations.

## Example Context (DP on Subsets)

In DP on subsets, the popcount of the current mask is often needed to determine the position or size of the subset. Precomputing the `pc` array allows fetching this value in O(1) inside the main O(N * 2^N) loop, which can yield noticeable speedups compared to calculating it repeatedly using `bin().count('1')`.
