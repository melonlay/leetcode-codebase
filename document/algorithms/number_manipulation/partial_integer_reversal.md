# Algorithm: Partial Integer Reversal (Latter Half)

## Description

This algorithm focuses on the technique of reversing the digits of the latter half of an integer. It iteratively extracts digits from the end of the original number and constructs a new number representing this reversed latter portion.

## Core Mechanism

1.  Initialize a `reversed_latter_half` variable to 0.
2.  Use a loop that continues as long as the `original_number` is greater than the `reversed_latter_half` being built.
3.  Inside the loop:
    a.  Extract the last digit of `original_number` using the modulo operator (`digit = original_number % 10`).
    b.  Append this `digit` to the `reversed_latter_half` by multiplying by 10 and adding (`reversed_latter_half = reversed_latter_half * 10 + digit`).
    c.  Remove the last digit from `original_number` using integer division (`original_number //= 10`).
4.  The loop terminates when roughly half the digits have been processed. At this point:
    *   `original_number` holds the remaining first half of the digits.
    *   `reversed_latter_half` holds the reversed second half of the digits (potentially including the middle digit if the original number had an odd number of digits).

## Application: Integer Palindrome Check

This technique is commonly used to check if an integer is a palindrome without converting it to a string.

1.  **Edge Cases:** First, handle common palindrome edge cases:
    *   Negative numbers are typically not palindromes.
    *   Numbers ending in 0 (except 0 itself) cannot be palindromes (since the leading digit wouldn't be 0).
    *   Single-digit numbers (0-9) are always palindromes.
2.  **Apply Reversal Mechanism:** Use the core mechanism described above to get `original_number` (first half) and `reversed_latter_half`.
3.  **Comparison:**
    *   If the original number had an *even* number of digits, the integer is a palindrome if `original_number == reversed_latter_half`.
    *   If the original number had an *odd* number of digits, the middle digit ends up as the last digit processed into `reversed_latter_half`. Since the middle digit doesn't affect the palindrome property, we can ignore it by comparing `original_number == reversed_latter_half // 10`.
    *   Therefore, the check becomes `original_number == reversed_latter_half or original_number == reversed_latter_half // 10`.

```python
# Example Implementation for Palindrome Check
def is_palindrome_int(x: int) -> bool:
    # 1. Handle edge cases
    if x < 0 or (x % 10 == 0 and x != 0):
        return False
    if x < 10:
        return True

    reversed_latter_half = 0
    original_num = x

    # 2. Apply Core Reversal Mechanism
    while original_num > reversed_latter_half:
        digit = original_num % 10
        reversed_latter_half = reversed_latter_half * 10 + digit
        original_num //= 10

    # 3. Comparison for Palindrome
    return original_num == reversed_latter_half or original_num == reversed_latter_half // 10
```

## Complexity (of the reversal mechanism)

*   **Time Complexity:** O(log10(N)), where N is the value of the integer. We process roughly half the digits.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1).

## Benefits

*   Avoids full integer reversal, reducing potential overflow issues compared to reversing the entire number.
*   Operates purely on integer arithmetic, avoiding string conversions.

## Potential Issues

*   **Integer Overflow:** While less likely than full reversal, building `reversed_latter_half` could still theoretically overflow if the original number is very large (near `INT_MAX`) and its reversed half exceeds the limit. This is rare in typical integer ranges for competitive programming.
