# Algorithm: Iterative Linked List Segment Reversal

## General Description

This algorithm addresses problems requiring the reversal of contiguous segments (or chunks) within a linked list. A common variation involves reversing segments of a fixed size `k`, often leaving any final partial segment (smaller than `k`) unchanged. However, the core technique can be adapted for segments defined by other criteria or different handling of the final segment.

## Core Algorithm/Mechanism

The strategy involves iterating through the linked list and processing it segment by segment. A dummy node is highly recommended to simplify handling the head of the list and the connections between segments.

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create a `dummy` node pointing to the original `head`.
    *   Initialize `prev_segment_tail = dummy`. This pointer tracks the tail of the *previously* processed segment (or the dummy node initially). It's needed to connect to the head of the *next* reversed segment.
    *   Initialize `current_segment_start = head`. This pointer marks the beginning of the potential next segment to be processed.

2.  **Iteration and Segment Identification:**
    *   Loop while `current_segment_start` is valid.
    *   **Identify Segment End:** Starting from `current_segment_start`, determine the end of the current segment based on the problem's criteria (e.g., traverse `k` nodes for fixed-size segments). Let `segment_end_next` be the node *after* the identified segment.
    *   **Check Validity:** Verify if a complete/valid segment was identified according to the criteria (e.g., for fixed size `k`, check if `k` nodes were successfully traversed).

3.  **Reversal (if valid segment identified):**
    *   Store the node that will be the start of the *next* segment (`next_segment_start = segment_end_next`).
    *   Store the head of the *current* segment (`segment_head = current_segment_start`). This node will become the *tail* of the reversed segment.
    *   Perform an in-place reversal of the nodes within the identified segment (from `current_segment_start` up to, but not including, `segment_end_next`).
        *   Use standard iterative reversal: Initialize `prev = next_segment_start`.
        *   Iterate through the nodes of the segment: `next_temp = curr.next`, `curr.next = prev`, `prev = curr`, `curr = next_temp`.
        *   After the loop, `prev` points to the new head of the reversed segment.

4.  **Reconnection:**
    *   Connect the tail of the previous segment to the new head of the reversed segment: `prev_segment_tail.next = prev`.
    *   Connect the new tail of the reversed segment (the original `segment_head`) to the start of the next segment: `segment_head.next = next_segment_start`.

5.  **Advance Pointers:**
    *   Update `prev_segment_tail` to point to the tail of the *just reversed* segment (which is `segment_head`): `prev_segment_tail = segment_head`.
    *   Update `current_segment_start` to the start of the next potential segment: `current_segment_start = next_segment_start`.

6.  **Termination:**
    *   If, during the segment identification step, a valid segment cannot be formed (e.g., fewer than `k` nodes remain), break the loop or handle the remaining nodes according to the problem specification (e.g., leave them unchanged).

7.  **Return:** Return `dummy.next`, which points to the head of the fully modified list.

## Complexity (for fixed-size k segments)

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the total number of nodes. Each node is visited a constant number of times.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). The reversal is done in-place.

## Example Application(s)

*   **LeetCode 25: Reverse Nodes in k-Group:** Reverses segments of fixed size `k`, leaving the last partial segment as is.
*   **(Potential Variations):** Reversing segments between specific value nodes, reversing every other segment, etc.

```python
# Illustrative Snippet (Fixed size k, matches LeetCode 25)
# Assumes ListNode class definition exists
def reverse_fixed_size_segments(head, k):
    if not head or k == 1: return head
    dummy = ListNode(0, head)
    prev_segment_tail = dummy
    current_segment_start = head

    while True:
        # Identify Segment End (find k-th node)
        segment_end = current_segment_start
        count = 0
        while segment_end and count < k:
            segment_end = segment_end.next
            count += 1

        if count == k: # Full segment found
            next_segment_start = segment_end # Node after the segment
            # Reverse
            prev = next_segment_start
            curr = current_segment_start
            segment_head = current_segment_start # Will become tail
            for _ in range(k):
                next_temp = curr.next
                curr.next = prev
                prev = curr
                curr = next_temp
            
            # Reconnect
            # prev is now the new head
            prev_segment_tail.next = prev 
            segment_head.next = next_segment_start # New tail connects

            # Advance
            prev_segment_tail = segment_head
            current_segment_start = next_segment_start
        else: # Not enough nodes for a full segment
            break
            
    return dummy.next
```

## Pitfalls

*   Off-by-one errors in identifying segment boundaries or during the reversal loop count.
*   Incorrectly managing connections: Ensure the previous segment's tail points to the *new* head of the reversed segment, and the *new* tail points correctly to the node *after* the segment.
*   Forgetting to update `prev_segment_tail` and `current_segment_start` correctly for the next iteration.
*   Not handling edge cases like `k=1`, empty list, or list shorter than `k` appropriately.
*   Not using a dummy node can significantly complicate handling the connection for the very first segment.
