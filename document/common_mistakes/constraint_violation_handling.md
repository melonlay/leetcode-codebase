# Handling Input Outside Stated Constraints

## Description

LeetCode problems provide constraints that define the valid range of inputs (e.g., array sizes, value ranges). While solutions should primarily focus on handling valid inputs efficiently and correctly, sometimes the chosen algorithm might exhibit unexpected behavior or errors if applied to inputs *outside* these constraints.

It's important to be aware of how your algorithm behaves at the absolute boundaries and just beyond the specified constraints, even if such inputs are technically invalid for the specific problem.

## Example: Median of Two Sorted Arrays (LeetCode 4)

*   **Problem Constraint:** `1 <= m + n <= 2000`, where `m` and `n` are array lengths.
*   **Issue:** The standard binary search algorithm for this problem involves partitioning. If tested with `m = 0` and `n = 0` (violating the constraint `m + n >= 1`), the core logic might proceed without error but produce `nan` (Not a Number) due to calculations like `(-infinity + infinity) / 2.0`, or potentially raise an `IndexError` depending on implementation details.
*   **Mitigation:** While not strictly necessary for passing LeetCode tests (due to the constraint guarantee), robust code might include an initial check for such constraint violations (`if m + n == 0: raise ValueError(...)`) to provide clearer error messages or prevent unexpected behavior in different contexts.

## Why Consider This?

*   **Robustness:** Makes code more resilient if used outside the specific LeetCode environment where constraints might differ.
*   **Debugging:** Understanding behavior with invalid inputs can sometimes help diagnose issues with valid inputs near the boundaries.
*   **Clarity:** Explicitly handling invalid edge cases can make the code's assumptions and limitations clearer.

## When *Not* to Over-Optimize for Invalid Inputs

Don't overly complicate your LeetCode solution by adding extensive checks for conditions *explicitly ruled out* by the constraints if it impacts performance or readability significantly. The primary goal is to solve the problem *as stated* with its *given constraints*. However, being *aware* of how the algorithm behaves just outside those constraints is beneficial.
