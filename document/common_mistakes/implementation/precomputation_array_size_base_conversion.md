# Common Mistake: Incorrect Precomputation Array Size with Base Conversion

## Context

When solving problems that involve:
1.  Precomputing values (e.g., factorials, inverse factorials for `nCr`, powers).
2.  Converting input numbers (often given in base 10) to a different base `b`.

## The Mistake

Incorrectly sizing the precomputed arrays based only on the constraints of the *input* format (e.g., maximum length of a decimal string) without considering the maximum possible size needed after *base conversion*.

The number of digits required to represent a number `N` in base `b` is approximately `log_b(N)`. If `N` is derived from a base-10 string of length `L` (so `N ~ 10^L`), the number of digits in base `b` is `log_b(10^L) = L * log_b(10)`. 

*   If `b < 10`, then `log_b(10) > 1`, meaning the number of digits *increases*. The increase is largest for `b=2`, where `log2(10) ~ 3.32`. A 100-digit decimal number can require over 330 digits in base 2.
*   If `b = 10`, the length remains the same.

If precomputed arrays (like factorials for `nCr(n, k)`) are sized based only on the input length `L` (or `L + b`), calculations involving `n = number_of_digits_in_base_b` (which can be much larger than `L`) or `n = number_of_digits_in_base_b + b` may lead to an `IndexError: list index out of range`.

## Example Scenario (Problem 3519)

*   Input `r` is a decimal string up to length 100.
*   Calculations involve `nCr` on values related to the number of digits `n` in base `b` (up to ~335 for `b=2`) and the base `b` itself.
*   Need `nCr(n_digits + b - 1, k)` for combinations with repetition.
*   The maximum value `N` needed for `fact[N]` is roughly `max_digits_in_base_b + b`.
*   Sizing `fact` based only on `len(r) + b` (e.g., `100 + 10 = 110`) is insufficient when `b=2` (need ~345).

## Correct Approach

1.  Determine the maximum possible number of digits (`max_digits`) the number can have in the target base `b`, considering the maximum input value (e.g., `floor(max_input_len * log_b(10)) + buffer`).
2.  Determine the maximum argument `max_N` that will be passed to functions using precomputed arrays (e.g., `nCr(n, k)` might need `n` up to `max_digits + b`).
3.  Size the precomputed arrays generously based on `max_N`.
