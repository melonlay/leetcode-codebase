# 3530. Maximum Profit from Valid Topological Order in DAG

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Topics:** Graph, Dynamic Programming, Topological Sort, Bit Manipulation, Bitmask

You are given a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, represented by a 2D array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates a directed edge from node `ui` to `vi`. Each node has an associated `score` given in an array `score`, where `score[i]` represents the score of node `i`.

You must process the nodes in a valid **topological order**. Each node is assigned a **1-based position** in the processing order.

The **profit** is calculated by summing up the product of each node's score and its position in the ordering.

Return the **maximum** possible profit achievable with an optimal topological order.

A **topological order** of a DAG is a linear ordering of its nodes such that for every directed edge `u -> v`, node `u` comes before `v` in the ordering.

**Example 1:**

Input: `n = 2`, `edges = [[0,1]]`, `score = [2,3]`
Output: `8`
Explanation:
The graph has nodes 0 and 1 with an edge 0 -> 1.
Node 1 depends on node 0, so a valid order is `[0, 1]`.

| Node | Processing Order | Score | Multiplier | Profit Calculation |
| :--- | :--------------- | :---- | :--------- | :----------------- |
| 0    | 1st              | 2     | 1          | 2 * 1 = 2          |
| 1    | 2nd              | 3     | 2          | 3 * 2 = 6          |

The maximum total profit achievable over all valid topological orders is 2 + 6 = 8.

**Example 2:**

Input: `n = 3`, `edges = [[0,1],[0,2]]`, `score = [1,6,3]`
Output: `25`
Explanation:
The graph has node 0 pointing to nodes 1 and 2.
Nodes 1 and 2 depend on node 0, so the most optimal valid order is `[0, 2, 1]`.

| Node | Processing Order | Score | Multiplier | Profit Calculation |
| :--- | :--------------- | :---- | :--------- | :----------------- |
| 0    | 1st              | 1     | 1          | 1 * 1 = 1          |
| 2    | 2nd              | 3     | 2          | 3 * 2 = 6          |
| 1    | 3rd              | 6     | 3          | 6 * 3 = 18         |

The maximum total profit achievable over all valid topological orders is 1 + 6 + 18 = 25.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n == score.length <= 22`
*   `1 <= score[i] <= 10^5`
*   `0 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
*   `edges[i] == [ui, vi]` denotes a directed edge from `ui` to `vi`.
*   `0 <= ui, vi < n`
*   `ui != vi`
*   The input graph is guaranteed to be a **DAG**.
*   There are no duplicate edges.
