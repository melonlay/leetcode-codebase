# Solution Explanation for LeetCode 3524: Find X Value of Array I

## Problem Summary

Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `k`, we need to find the "X-value" of the array. The X-value is an array `result` of size `k`. For each index `x` (from 0 to `k-1`), `result[x]` represents the total number of ways we can perform a specific operation exactly once, such that the product of the remaining elements modulo `k` equals `x`.

The operation involves choosing a prefix `nums[0...p-1]` (possibly empty, `p >= 0`) and a suffix `nums[n-s...n-1]` (possibly empty, `s >= 0`) to remove from `nums`. The key constraint is that the remaining subarray `nums[p...n-s-1]` must be non-empty, which means `p + s < n` (where `n` is the length of `nums`).

Essentially, we need to consider every possible non-empty contiguous subarray `nums[i...j]` (where `0 <= i <= j < n`), calculate its product modulo `k`, and count how many subarrays result in each possible remainder `x` from `0` to `k-1`.

## Approach: Dynamic Programming

A naive approach iterating through all `O(n^2)` subarrays and calculating their products would be too slow (potentially `O(n^3)` or `O(n^2)`). The constraints `n <= 10^5` and especially the small `k <= 5` suggest a more efficient approach, likely involving dynamic programming.

We can process the array `nums` from left to right (index `j` from `0` to `n-1`). We maintain a DP state that tracks information about subarrays ending at the current index `j`.

Let `dp[r]` be the count of subarrays ending exactly at index `j` whose product modulo `k` is equal to `r`. This `dp` array will have size `k`.

We also maintain the final `result` array (size `k`), which accumulates the counts from the `dp` states at each step `j`.

**Algorithm:**

1.  Initialize `result = [0] * k`.
2.  Initialize `dp = [0] * k` (representing counts for subarrays ending *before* the first element, i.e., none).
3.  Iterate through `nums` with index `j` from `0` to `n-1`:
    a.  Get the current value modulo `k`: `v = nums[j] % k`.
    b.  Create a `new_dp = [0] * k` to store the counts for subarrays ending at index `j`.
    c.  **Extend previous subarrays:** Iterate through all possible previous remainders `r_prev` from `0` to `k-1`. If `dp[r_prev] > 0`, it means there were `dp[r_prev]` subarrays ending at `j-1` with product `r_prev % k`. Appending `nums[j]` to these subarrays creates `dp[r_prev]` new subarrays ending at `j` with product `(r_prev * v) % k`. Add this count to `new_dp`:
        `new_r = (r_prev * v) % k`
        `new_dp[new_r] += dp[r_prev]`
    d.  **Add single-element subarray:** The subarray consisting only of `nums[j]` ends at `j` and has product `v % k`. Increment the count for this remainder:
        `new_dp[v] += 1`
    e.  **Accumulate results:** The `new_dp` array now contains the counts for all subarrays ending exactly at index `j`. Add these counts to the overall `result` array:
        `for r in range(k): result[r] += new_dp[r]`
    f.  **Update DP state:** For the next iteration (`j+1`), the `dp` state becomes the `new_dp` state we just calculated:
        `dp = new_dp`
4.  Return `result`.

**Example Walkthrough (nums = [1, 2], k = 3):**

*   Initialize: `result = [0, 0, 0]`, `dp = [0, 0, 0]`
*   **j = 0 (nums[0] = 1):**
    *   `v = 1 % 3 = 1`
    *   `new_dp = [0, 0, 0]`
    *   Extend previous (none): loop does nothing.
    *   Single element `[1]`: `new_dp[1] += 1` -> `new_dp = [0, 1, 0]`
    *   Accumulate: `result = [0, 1, 0]`
    *   Update: `dp = [0, 1, 0]`
*   **j = 1 (nums[1] = 2):**
    *   `v = 2 % 3 = 2`
    *   `new_dp = [0, 0, 0]`
    *   Extend previous (`dp = [0, 1, 0]`):
        *   `r_prev = 1`: `dp[1] = 1`. `new_r = (1 * 2) % 3 = 2`. `new_dp[2] += 1`. `new_dp = [0, 0, 1]`
    *   Single element `[2]`: `new_dp[2] += 1` -> `new_dp = [0, 0, 2]`
    *   Accumulate: `result = [0+0, 1+0, 0+2] = [0, 1, 2]`
    *   Update: `dp = [0, 0, 2]`
*   End loop. Return `result = [0, 1, 2]`.

Let's check subarrays manually: `[1]` (prod=1, mod=1), `[2]` (prod=2, mod=2), `[1, 2]` (prod=2, mod=2). Counts: {1: 1, 2: 2}. Final result `[0, 1, 2]`. Matches.

## Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n * k). We iterate through the `nums` array once (O(n)). Inside the loop, we iterate through the `dp` array of size `k` to calculate `new_dp`, and then iterate through `new_dp` (size `k`) to update `result`. Each step inside the loop takes O(k) time.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(k). We use the `result` array and the `dp` (and `new_dp`) array, all of size `k`.

This complexity is efficient enough for the given constraints.

## Advanced Optimization: State Packing

A significantly faster approach (often 5x or more in Python for small `k`) avoids using an explicit `dp` array. It packs the `k` counters into a single large integer and uses bitwise operations (shifts and masks) to perform the state updates. While the asymptotic complexity remains O(n * k), the constant factor is much lower.
