# Problem 3538: Merge Operations for Minimum Travel Time

## Problem Description

(Summary of the problem statement)

## Solution Approach: Dynamic Programming

The problem asks for the minimum total time after exactly `k` merges. Since the greedy approach (always choosing the merge with the lowest instantaneous cost) fails (as demonstrated by test cases), we turn to Dynamic Programming.

### 1. DP State Definition
We define two DP states to capture the necessary information:

*   `f[i][j]`: Minimum total travel time considering segments `0` through `i`, having performed exactly `j` merges among boundaries `1` through `i`, with the condition that boundary `i` (between segment `i-1` and segment `i`) was **NOT** merged.
*   `g[i][j]`: Minimum total travel time considering segments `0` through `i`, having performed exactly `j` merges among boundaries `1` through `i`, with the condition that boundary `i` **WAS** merged.

Here:
*   `i` is the index of the *last segment* considered (ranging from 0 to `n-2`).
*   `j` is the number of merges performed so far (ranging from 0 to `k`).

### 2. Base Case
*   For the first segment (`i=0`), no merges are possible at boundary 0. The only valid state is `f[0][0]`, representing the time taken for segment 0. `f[0][0] = D[0] * T[0]`, where `D` is the distance array and `T` is the original time array.
*   All other `f[0][j]` and all `g[0][j]` are initialized to infinity.

### 3. Transitions
We iterate through segments `i` from 1 to `n-2` and merges `j` from 0 to `k`.

*   **Calculating `f[i][j]` (Boundary `i` NOT merged):**
    The time for segment `i` depends on whether the *previous* boundary `i-1` was merged.
    *   If we arrive from `f[i-1][j]` (boundary `i-1` not merged), the time for segment `i` is `D[i] * T[i]`. Total time = `f[i-1][j] + D[i] * T[i]`.
    *   If we arrive from `g[i-1][j]` (boundary `i-1` was merged), the effective time/km for segment `i` is increased by `T[i-1]` due to that previous merge. Time for segment `i` is `D[i] * (T[i] + T[i-1])`. Total time = `g[i-1][j] + D[i] * (T[i] + T[i-1])`.
    *   `f[i][j] = min(time_from_f, time_from_g)`.

*   **Calculating `g[i][j]` (Boundary `i` IS merged):** Requires `j >= 1`.
    This state is reached by being in a state at `i-1` with `j-1` merges and then performing the merge operation at boundary `i`.
    *   Define `cost_delta(boundary, time_prev_effective)` as the change in total time caused by merging `boundary`, given the effective time/km of the preceding segment.
        *   `cost_delta_i = D[i] * (T[i-1] - T[i]) + D[i+1] * T[i]` (used if boundary `i-1` was not merged).
        *   `cost_delta_merged_i = D[i] * ((T[i-2] + T[i-1]) - T[i]) + D[i+1] * T[i]` (used if boundary `i-1` was merged, requires `i>=2`).
    *   If we arrive from `f[i-1][j-1]` (boundary `i-1` not merged): The total time *before* performing merge `i` is `f[i-1][j-1] + D[i] * T[i]`. The total time *after* merge `i` is `(f[i-1][j-1] + D[i] * T[i]) + cost_delta_i`.
    *   If we arrive from `g[i-1][j-1]` (boundary `i-1` was merged, requires `i>=2`): The total time *before* merge `i` is `g[i-1][j-1] + D[i] * (T[i] + T[i-1])`. The total time *after* merge `i` is `(g[i-1][j-1] + D[i] * (T[i] + T[i-1])) + cost_delta_merged_i`.
    *   `g[i][j] = min(time_from_f, time_from_g)`.

### 4. Final Result
After filling the DP tables, the minimum time after considering all segments (`0` to `n-2`) and using exactly `k` merges is `min(f[n-2][k], g[n-2][k])`. Boundary `n-1` (after the last segment) cannot be merged.

### 5. Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(N * K), where N is the number of signs (`n`). We have O(N*K) states, and each transition takes O(1) time.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N * K) for the DP tables `f` and `g`.
