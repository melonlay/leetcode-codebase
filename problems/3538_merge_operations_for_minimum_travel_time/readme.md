# 3538. Merge Operations for Minimum Travel Time

You are given a straight road of length `1` km, an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and two integer arrays, `position` and `time`, each of length `n`.

The array `position` lists the positions (in km) of signs in **strictly increasing order** (with `position[0] = 0` and `position[n - 1] = 1`).

Each `time[i]` represents the time (in minutes) required to travel 1 km between `position[i]` and `position[i + 1]`.

You must perform **exactly** `k` merge operations. In one merge, you can choose any **two** adjacent signs at indices `i` and `i + 1` (with `i > 0` and `i + 1 < n`) and:

*   Update the sign at index `i + 1` so that its time becomes `time[i] + time[i + 1]`.
*   Remove the sign at index `i`.

Return the **minimum total travel time** (in minutes) to travel from 0 to 1 after **exactly** `k` merges.

**Example 1:**

Input: l = 10, n = 4, k = 1, position = [0,3,8,10], time = [5,8,3,6]
Output: 62
Explanation:
*   Merge the signs at indices 1 and 2. Remove the sign at index 1, and change the time at index 2 to `8 + 3 = 11`.
*   After the merge:
    *   `position` array: `[0, 8, 10]`
    *   `time` array: `[5, 11, 6]`
*   Segment Table:
    | Segment | Distance (km) | Time per km (min) | Segment Travel Time (min) |
    |---------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
    | 0 - 8   | 8             | 5                 | 8 x 5 = 40                |
    | 8 - 10  | 2             | 11                | 2 x 11 = 22               |
*   Total Travel Time: `40 + 22 = 62`, which is the minimum possible time after exactly 1 merge.

**Example 2:**

Input: l = 5, n = 5, k = 1, position = [0,1,2,3,5], time = [8,3,9,3,3]
Output: 34
Explanation:
*   Merge the signs at indices 1 and 2. Remove the sign at index 1, and change the time at index 2 to `3 + 9 = 12`.
*   After the merge:
    *   `position` array: `[0, 2, 3, 5]`
    *   `time` array: `[8, 12, 3, 3]`
*   Segment Table:
    | Segment | Distance (km) | Time per km (min) | Segment Travel Time (min) |
    |---------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
    | 0 - 2   | 2             | 8                 | 2 x 8 = 16                |
    | 2 - 3   | 1             | 12                | 1 x 12 = 12               |
    | 3 - 5   | 2             | 3                 | 2 x 3 = 6                 |
*   Total Travel Time: `16 + 12 + 6 = 34`.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= l <= 10^6`
*   `2 <= n <= min(l + 1, 50)`
*   `0 <= k <= min(n - 2, 10)`
*   `position.length == n`
*   `time.length == n`
*   `position[0] == 0` and `position[n - 1] == 1` (?) -> Problem statement says road length is 1km, but example 1 has positions up to 10. Let's assume positions are absolute and the road length `l` constraint might be misleading or intended differently. The examples use the positions directly. Let's assume `position[n-1]` is the end, not necessarily 1.
*   `position` is sorted in strictly increasing order.
*   `1 <= time[i] <= 100`
*   `1 <= sum(time) <= 100` (?) -> This seems very low based on example times. Re-checking problem source might be needed if this constraint causes issues. Assuming individual `time[i]` constraint is the main one.
*   All input integers fit in a 32-bit signed integer type.

**Note:** The constraints regarding `l` and `sum(time)` seem inconsistent with the examples. The solution will proceed based on the example logic, where `position` values determine distances and `time` array values are times per km.
