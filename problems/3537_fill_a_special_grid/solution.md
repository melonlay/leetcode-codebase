# Solution for 100626. Fill a Special Grid

## Problem Summary

Given an integer `N`, we need to construct a \(2^N \times 2^N\) grid filled with unique integers from 0 to \(2^{2N} - 1\). The grid must be "special," meaning:
1.  Numbers in the top-right (TR) quadrant are strictly less than numbers in the bottom-right (BR) quadrant.
2.  Numbers in the BR quadrant are strictly less than numbers in the bottom-left (BL) quadrant.
3.  Numbers in the BL quadrant are strictly less than numbers in the top-left (TL) quadrant.
4.  Each quadrant itself must also be a special grid.
A 1x1 grid (N=0) is considered special.

## Approach: Recursive Divide and Conquer with Offsets

The problem definition has a clear recursive structure. A special grid of size \(2^N \times 2^N\) is built from four special subgrids of size \(2^{N-1} \times 2^{N-1}\).

The key challenge is assigning the numbers (0 to \(2^{2N} - 1\)) correctly to satisfy the ordering constraints between quadrants.

Let the total number of cells in a \(2^n \times 2^n\) grid be \(S_n = 2^{2n} = 4^n\).
The four quadrants of a \(2^n \times 2^n\) grid are each \(2^{n-1} \times 2^{n-1}\) and thus contain \(S_{n-1} = 4^{n-1} = S_n / 4\) cells.

The ordering constraints `max(TR) < min(BR) < min(BL) < min(TL)` suggest dividing the total range of numbers `[0, S_n - 1]` into four equal, contiguous blocks, each of size \(S_{n-1}\):
*   Block 0: `[0 * S_{n-1}, 1 * S_{n-1} - 1]`
*   Block 1: `[1 * S_{n-1}, 2 * S_{n-1} - 1]`
*   Block 2: `[2 * S_{n-1}, 3 * S_{n-1} - 1]`
*   Block 3: `[3 * S_{n-1}, 4 * S_{n-1} - 1]`

To satisfy the constraints, we assign these blocks to the quadrants in ascending order:
*   Top-Right (TR) gets Block 0.
*   Bottom-Right (BR) gets Block 1.
*   Bottom-Left (BL) gets Block 2.
*   Top-Left (TL) gets Block 3.

This leads to a recursive function `_fill(n, offset)`:
*   **Input:** `n` (current dimension level, corresponds to \(2^n \times 2^n\)) and `offset` (the starting value for the number range assigned to this grid).
*   **Base Case:** If `n == 0`, return a 1x1 grid `[[offset]]`.
*   **Recursive Step:**
    1.  Calculate the size of the sub-quadrants (`sub_size = 2^(n-1)`) and the number of elements in each sub-quadrant (`quadrant_count = 4^(n-1)`).
    2.  Recursively call `_fill` for each quadrant, passing `n-1` and the calculated offset based on the block assignment:
        *   `tr = _fill(n - 1, offset)` (Block 0 starts at `offset`)
        *   `br = _fill(n - 1, offset + quadrant_count)` (Block 1 starts after Block 0)
        *   `bl = _fill(n - 1, offset + 2 * quadrant_count)` (Block 2 starts after Block 1)
        *   `tl = _fill(n - 1, offset + 3 * quadrant_count)` (Block 3 starts after Block 2)
    3.  Construct the current grid by combining the results (`tl`, `tr`, `bl`, `br`) into the appropriate positions.
    4.  Return the constructed grid.

## Implementation Details

*   **Memoization:** The `_fill(n, offset)` function can be called multiple times with the same arguments if not careful (though in this specific structure, it might not repeat calls naturally). However, memoization using a dictionary `memo[(n, offset)]` is added as a good practice for recursive functions that might have overlapping subproblems. It stores the computed grid for a given `(n, offset)` pair.
*   **Bit Shifts:** Powers of 2 (like `2^n`) are efficiently calculated using bit shifts (`1 << n`). The number of elements in a quadrant `4^(n-1)` can be calculated as `1 << (2 * n - 2)`.

## Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:** Let \(T(n)\) be the time to compute the grid for `N=n`. The recurrence is \(T(n) = 4 * T(n-1) + O(4^n)\), where \(O(4^n)\) is the time to combine the four subgrids (copying \(4^n\) elements). The base case is \(T(0) = O(1)\). This solves to \(T(N) = O(N \cdot 4^N)\) without memoization (due to the copying cost at each level), but since the copying dominates, it's closer to \(O(\sum_{i=0}^{N} 4 \cdot 4^i) = O(4^N)\). With memoization, if subproblems were overlapping (which they aren't significantly here), it would prevent recomputation, but the dominant cost remains the grid construction. The total number of cells is \(4^N\), and each cell is filled once during the construction phase. Thus, the time complexity is **O(\(4^N\))** or **O(\(S\))**, where \(S = 2^{2N}\) is the total number of cells.
*   **Space Complexity:** The recursion depth is O(N). The memoization table could store grids at different levels. The largest grid is \(2^N \times 2^N\). The space used by the memoization table and the recursion stack contributes, but the dominant factor is the final output grid. Therefore, the space complexity is **O(\(4^N\))** or **O(\(S\))**.

## Foundational Concepts Used

*   **Recursion & Divide and Conquer:** The solution directly implements the recursive definition of the special grid. The problem is broken down into smaller, independent subproblems (quadrants) which are solved recursively and then combined. See [[../../patterns/divide_and_conquer/divide_and_conquer.md]].
*   **Memoization:** Used as a potential optimization for the recursive calls (though not strictly necessary for correctness in this specific call structure). See [[../../techniques/recursion/memoization.md]].
*   **Specific Technique:** The core logic follows a recursive quadrant construction pattern. See [[../../techniques/grid_processing/recursive_quadrant_construction.md]].
