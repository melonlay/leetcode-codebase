# LeetCode 3525: Find X Value of Array II

## 1. Problem Summary

We are given an array `nums` of positive integers and a small integer `k`. We process a series of queries. Each query `[index, value, start, x_target]` involves:
1.  Updating `nums[index]` to `value` (this update persists for future queries).
2.  Considering the subarray `current_nums = nums[start:]`.
3.  Calculating the "x-value" for `x = x_target`. The x-value is the number of non-empty prefixes `P` of `current_nums` such that the product of elements in `P`, taken modulo `k`, equals `x_target`.

We need to return an array containing the calculated x-value for each query.

## 2. Approach: Segment Tree with Custom Node State

The problem involves point updates and range queries on an array. The key observation is that `k` is very small (`k <= 5`). This allows us to use a data structure like a Segment Tree where each node stores information dependent on `k`.

We design a Segment Tree where each node represents an interval `[tl, tr]` of the original `nums` array and stores a tuple:
`(product_mod_k, counts_array)`

*   `product_mod_k`: The product of all elements `nums[i]` for `tl <= i <= tr`, calculated modulo `k`.
*   `counts_array`: An array of size `k`. `counts_array[rem]` stores the number of prefixes of the segment `nums[tl...tr]` (i.e., subarrays `nums[tl...j]` where `tl <= j <= tr`) whose product modulo `k` is equal to `rem`.
*   **Implementation Note:** Given the small constraint `k <= 5`, the `counts_array` is implemented using a fixed-size tuple instead of a list. This might offer a slight performance improvement due to tuple immutability and potentially faster access compared to lists in Python for very small, fixed sizes.

### Combination Logic

When combining the results from a left child `L` (range `[tl, tm]`) and a right child `R` (range `[tm+1, tr]`), we need to compute the state for the parent node `P` (range `[tl, tr]`):

1.  `P.product_mod_k = (L.product_mod_k * R.product_mod_k) % k`
2.  `P.counts_array` calculation:
    *   Initialize `P.counts_array` as a copy of `L.counts_array`. These represent the prefixes ending within the left child's range.
    *   Iterate through each remainder `r_rem` (from 0 to `k-1`) and its count `count = R.counts_array[r_rem]` from the right child.
    *   These `count` prefixes start at `tm+1` and have a product of `r_rem % k`.
    *   To extend these prefixes to start from `tl`, we need to multiply them by the total product of the left segment (`L.product_mod_k`).
    *   The new remainder for these extended prefixes is `final_rem = (L.product_mod_k * r_rem) % k`.
    *   Add the `count` to `P.counts_array[final_rem]`. `P.counts_array[final_rem] += count`.

This combination logic takes O(k) time.

### Operations

*   **Build:** Standard segment tree build, using the O(k) combine logic. Complexity: O(n * k).
*   **Update:** Standard point update. Traverse down to the leaf, update its value `(new_val % k, counts)` where `counts[new_val % k] = 1`, and propagate changes back up using the O(k) combine logic. Complexity: O(k * log n).
*   **Query:** To answer a query `(start, x_target)`, we perform a range query on the segment tree for the interval `[start, n-1]`. The standard segment tree query mechanism recursively combines results from nodes covering the query range. The final combined result `(total_prod, final_counts)` will have `final_counts[rem]` representing the number of prefixes starting at `start` and ending within `[start, n-1]` with product `rem % k`. The answer to the query is `final_counts[x_target]`. Complexity: O(k * log n).

## 3. Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   Build: O(n * k)
    *   Update per query: O(k * log n)
    *   Query per query: O(k * log n)
    *   Total: O(n*k + q*k*log n). Since `k <= 5`, this is effectively O(n + q log n).
*   **Space Complexity:** O(n * k) to store the tree nodes (each node stores an array of size k). Effectively O(n) since k is constant.
