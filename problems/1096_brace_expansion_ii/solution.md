# Solution Explanation: 1096. Brace Expansion II

## Problem Summary

The problem asks us to parse a string representing a set of words according to a specific grammar and return a sorted list of the unique words generated. The grammar involves:
1.  Single letters representing themselves.
2.  Comma-separated lists within braces `{e1, e2, ...}` representing the **union** of the sets generated by `e1, e2, ...`.
3.  Concatenation of expressions `e1e2` representing the **Cartesian product** of the sets generated by `e1` and `e2` (i.e., all possible concatenations `a+b` where `a` is from `R(e1)` and `b` is from `R(e2)`).

## Approach: Recursive Descent Parsing

The grammar's recursive nature strongly suggests a recursive descent parsing approach. We can define mutually recursive functions that mirror the grammar rules:

1.  `_parse_expression()`: Handles the union rule (`term, term, ...`). It calls `_parse_term()` to get the set for each term separated by commas and computes the union of these sets.
2.  `_parse_term()`: Handles the concatenation rule (`factor factor ...`). It calls `_parse_factor()` repeatedly for adjacent factors and computes the Cartesian product of their resulting sets. The base for the product is a set containing an empty string `{""}`.
3.  `_parse_factor()`: Handles the base cases. If it encounters an opening brace `'{'`, it consumes it, recursively calls `_parse_expression()` to evaluate the inner part, and consumes the closing brace `'}'`. If it encounters a letter, it consumes the sequence of letters to form a word and returns a set containing just that word.

An index `self.idx` is maintained as a class member to track the current position within the input `self.expression` string during parsing.

The main function `braceExpansionII` initializes the index, calls `_parse_expression()` to start the parsing, and finally converts the resulting set of unique words into a sorted list.

## Implementation Details

-   **Set Operations:** Python's `set` data structure is used extensively. `set.update()` performs the union operation efficiently. The Cartesian product is implemented manually using nested loops over the sets being combined.
-   **Index Management:** Using `self.idx` simplifies passing the current parsing position between recursive calls.
-   **Base Cases:** The recursion bottoms out when `_parse_factor()` encounters a sequence of letters.
-   **Empty Braces `{}`:** The Cartesian product logic handles this correctly. If `_parse_factor` returns an empty set (because it parsed an empty `{}` via `_parse_expression`), the subsequent Cartesian product `result_product * {}` will correctly yield an empty set.

## Complexity Analysis

-   **Time Complexity:** This is difficult to determine precisely without deeper analysis of the maximum output size. In the worst case, the number of generated strings can grow exponentially with nesting and the size of unions/products (e.g., `{a,b}{c,d}{e,f}...`). However, given the constraint `expression.length <= 60`, the total number of operations (string concatenations, set additions) is bounded. Let N be the length of the expression and M be the total number of characters in the final output strings. Parsing takes roughly O(N), but the set operations and string concatenations depend on M. A loose upper bound might be O(N + M * L_avg), where L_avg is the average length of generated strings, considering the cost of concatenations and set insertions. In practice, for length 60, it should be fast enough.
-   **Space Complexity:** Primarily determined by the size of the intermediate sets and the final result set. In the worst case, this can also be exponential relative to N. O(M) space is needed to store the output strings. Recursion depth is limited by N.

## Alternative Approaches & Optimizations

An alternative iterative approach using an explicit stack can also solve this problem. This method often performs better in Python primarily due to **deferred uniqueness calculation** - it uses lists for intermediate steps and performs a single `set()` conversion at the end, avoiding the overhead of repeated intermediate set operations.
